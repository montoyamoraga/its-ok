# its-ok-to-laugh

## about

it's ok to laugh is a project i did as a final project for the class [reading and writing electronic text](http://rwet.decontextualize.com/), taught by [allison parrish](https://github.com/aparrish/) at [nyu itp](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp). it is also part of my [thesis](http://montoyamoraga.io/its_ok/). it is made of both a performance and a software tool.

the inspiration for this project came mainly from this comedy bit where [louis c.k.](https://louisck.net/) remembers a joke that her daughter invented.

![louis-ck-joke](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/its_ok_to_laugh/raw/master/louis_ck.jpg "louis c.k.")

i enjoyed the awkward premise of the joke and its totally unexpected and random punchline, and i wanted to recreate that feeling with software and performance.

i researched classical [joke cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke#Joke_cycles) and came up with a list of jokes that i wanted to recreate with software.

## software

i created a python module called [nonsequitur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(literary_device)), that is able to output chunks of text, where each different bit seems unrelated to what preceded them, in order to cause confusion and comedic effect. this is known as non sequitur, a literary device.

nonsequitur lives on [this github repository](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/nonsequiturpy) and is uploaded to the package index of python on [this site](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nonsequitur/). it can be installed through pip with the following command:

```shell
pip install nonsequitur
```

its dependencies are the python modules [pytracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery) and [pycorpora](https://github.com/aparrish/pycorpora), both developed by [allison parrish](https://github.com/aparrish/). pytracery is a port to python of the [tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) javascript library by [kate compton](https://github.com/galaxykate). pycorpora is a python interface to [darius kazemi](https://github.com/dariusk)'s [corpora project](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora).

pycorpora gives us access to a collection of static text corpora regarding different areas of interest. pytracery is a module that allows writing one-off recursive template/grammar expansion functions for text generation. i used pytracery in order to build up flexible joke structures, which included gaps in the text, which were filled using random choices picked from different sets of words, pulled from pycorpora.

in its current version, v0.0.5, nonsequitur is only capable of generating jokes, using the following functions with the corresponding outputs:

* america_russia(): joke that compares america and russia.
* bar(): joke that portrays the interaction between a bartender and a customer at the bar.
* chicken(): joke that answers why did the chicken cross the road.
* cows(): joke that tells what are the consequences of owning cows in different countries.
* knock_knock(): classic knock knock joke.
* lightbulb(): joke that addreses how many people of a particular profession are needed to change a particular quantity of lightbulbs.
* violas(): joke that compares violas and other items.
